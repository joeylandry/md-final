            <h2>What is the BeLoved Retreat?</h2>
            <div class="beloved-copy">
                <p>The BeLoved Retreat is a retreat for teens and adults to discover their true identity, worth, and beauty as the beloved daughter of God. It's a weekend like no other where women experience the unconditional love of God! The retreat answers women’s questions such as: Who am I? Am I loved unconditionally? Am I beautiful inside and out? What is my purpose? Am I worth it? With the knowledge that only God can bring these answers, BeLoved seeks to bring women into a deeper relationship with Him. They will discover their relationship with God, first as a daughter, recognizing that God is their Father, and secondly as a bride, as the Church is the bride of Christ.</p>
                <p>BeLoved answers these questions by unpacking the wisdom of Scripture, St. John Paul II and his Theology of the Body, St. Edith Stein, St. Catherine of Siena and other great saints. The talks are based on Scripture and Tradition along with dynamic witnesses. There are opportunities for the Sacraments such as Mass, Confession, and Adoration, where the women encounter Christ in a personal and powerful way. This allows the talks (based on Scripture and Catholic Tradition) to go from head to the heart.</p>
